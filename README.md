## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings â†’ API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Update `src/services/supabase.js` with your credentials:
   ```javascript
   const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL'
   const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'
   ```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Run the migration script from `supabase/migrations/create_applications_table.sql`
3. This will create:
   - Applications table with all required fields
   - Storage buckets for resumes and job descriptions
   - Row Level Security policies
   - Real-time subscriptions

### 3. Storage Setup

The migration script automatically creates two storage buckets:
- `resumes` - for storing resume files
- `jds` - for storing job description files

Both buckets are configured with public read access and appropriate policies.

### 4. Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
